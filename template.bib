abstract = {The Entity-Relationship (E-R) model is often recommended for use in the database design process because its concepts are perceived to be both natural and easy to use. This paper describes a methodology for the design of a relational database based on the E-R model. The methodology starts with the identification of the basic E-R constructs that occur in an application resulting in an initial database design. Next, ways of capturing certain semantics of an application through data abstraction and procedures for identifying potential design problems are discussed. The translation of the E-R model into a set of normalized relations completes the design process. This methodology builds on previous work on the Extended Entity-Relationship Model and on the automation of database design.}
